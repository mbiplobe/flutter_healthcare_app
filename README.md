## smart_health_care 
This application is designed to provide healthcare-related services. It originated as a fork of the [Healthcare Mobile App](https://github.com/TheAlphamerc/flutter_healthcare_app.git) and has since been extensively restructured and redesigned. While the initial project served as a benchmark reference, significant improvements and modifications have been introduced to enhance functionality, maintainability, and scalability.Originally developed using a simple Model-View (MV) architecture, the project has now been migrated to a more robust Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture. This transition ensures better separation of concerns, improved testability, and easier code maintenance.
The primary focus of this project is to deliver a modern, efficient, and well-structured healthcare service platform built with Flutter, while maintaining flexibility for future growth and feature expansion.
